            <section align="center">
                <p> I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in biology and a passion for technology and software. I 
                    developed an interest in development and analysis and took multiple courses outside the pre-medical 
                    track to further explore the fields. I am experienced in development and analyis using Python and I am 
                    currently working on gaining experience in cloud computing and web development. I hope to enter the 
                    field soon to further develop my knowledge and technical skills.
